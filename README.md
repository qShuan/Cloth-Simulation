## Build

### Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio 2022**: Ensure that Visual Studio 2022 is installed with the "Desktop Development with C++" workload.
- **C++20 Compiler**: The project requires a C++20 compiler (provided with Visual Studio 2022).

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qShuan/Cloth-Simulation.git
   cd Cloth-Simulation

2. **Open the solution**
   
      Locate and open the .sln file in Visual Studio 2022

4. **Build and run**
   
      Choose Release x64 configuration and build it from inside Visual Studio. Run it either directly from VS or launch the generated executable in the output directory (x64/Release/)
